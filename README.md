# 03-Javascript-Password-Generator
This application was created in order to take advantage of Javascript's capabilities to generate random passwords for the user. 
It gives the user the option to pick passwords that contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters if they please.

The assignment aims to target the following criteria

Ask the user a series of questions
a) length of password (numeric input)
b) validate length is between 8 and 128.
c) type of characters to include - special characters, uppercase, lowercase, numeric(series of yes/no confirms)
d) Validate the user selected at least one character type.

Any invalid response will terminate password generation and the user must start over.

Once the user has entered valid responses, generate a password that meets their criteria and display it in the box.
